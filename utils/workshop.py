"""Per-user resource scoping for concurrent workshop runs.

Multiple people run these modules against the same LangSmith workspace at the
same time. Any resource addressed by a shared *name* — tracing projects,
datasets, assistants, Context Hub repos, annotation queues, run rules — will be
overwritten by whoever runs last unless each user's name is unique.

`WORKSHOP_USER` (set in `.env`, e.g. "jane-doe") is the per-user token we splice
into every one of those names. Read it through `workshop_user()` so a missing or
placeholder value fails loudly instead of silently colliding on the shared
default.
